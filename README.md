# Indian Law AI Assistant

<p>The Indian Legal AI Assistant helps people understand legal documents in any Indian language. It supports PDFs, Word files, and images, detects the language, and explains the legal case in simple termsâ€”so anyone can understand without help from a lawyer. It also translates the explanation into different Indian languages.</p>

## Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/indian-legal-ai-assistant.git # Replace with the actual URL
    cd indian-legal-ai-assistant
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    Using a virtual environment helps manage project dependencies.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
    Activate the virtual environment:
    *   On macOS and Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    *   On Windows:
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Ensure your virtual environment is activated, then run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set Up API Keys:**
    This application requires API keys for AI services (OpenAI and/or Google Gemini) to perform analysis and translation.

    *   **Create `.env` file:** In the root directory of the project, create a new file named `.env`.
    *   **Copy from example:** Copy the contents from the `.env.example` file (which should be in the repository) into your new `.env` file. It will look like this:
        ```env
        # OpenAI API Key
        OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE"

        # Google Gemini API Key
        GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
        ```
    *   **Add your keys:** Replace `"YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE"` and `"YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"` with your actual API keys obtained from the respective providers.
        *   **OpenAI:** Keys can be found at [https://platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
        *   **Google Gemini:** Keys can be obtained from [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/) (formerly MakerSuite) or via Google Cloud (Vertex AI).
    *   **Minimum Requirement:** The application can operate if at least one of these API keys (either OpenAI or Gemini) is correctly configured and valid. If both are provided, you will be able to choose which model to use within the application. If a key is missing or invalid for a particular service, that service will not be available.

## Running the Application

Once the setup is complete and your virtual environment is activated:

1.  Run the Streamlit application:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
2.  Open your web browser and navigate to the local URL provided by Streamlit (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

## Important Considerations & Limitations

*   **API Key Costs:** Using AI models via API calls (OpenAI, Google Gemini) can incur costs. Please monitor your usage and set up billing alerts with the respective cloud providers.
*   **Not Legal Advice:** The analysis, summaries, and advice provided by this tool are generated by AI and are for informational purposes only. They should **not** be considered a substitute for professional legal advice from a qualified lawyer. Always consult with a legal professional for critical matters.
*   **Document Quality & OCR Accuracy:**
    *   The accuracy of text extraction, especially from PDF documents, can vary significantly. Scanned PDFs, handwritten notes, or documents with complex formatting, low resolution, or unusual fonts might yield less accurate or incomplete text extraction.
    *   Image processing (OCR) quality is also dependent on the clarity, resolution, and language of the image.
*   **AI Model Variability & Accuracy:**
    *   The quality, accuracy, and nature of the legal analysis depend heavily on the capabilities and training data of the chosen AI model (e.g., OpenAI's GPT series, Google's Gemini).
    *   AI models can sometimes provide plausible but incorrect or incomplete information ("hallucinations").
*   **Language Support & Translation Quality:** While the tool aims for broad language support for Indian languages, the quality of translation and nuanced understanding can vary by language and the specific AI model used.
*   **Document Truncation:** For very long documents, the text sent to the AI models might be truncated to fit within the context window limits of the AI. This is noted in the prompts, but it means analysis will be based on the (potentially incomplete) text provided.
